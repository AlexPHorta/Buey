**Burglar** is a *match 3* game with an innovative design, a circular grid that gets filled with color stones. The player's objective is to align three or more stones so that they're removed from the grid.

I developed Burglar some years ago, even intending to make it available for sale. Things got sour and I stopped the development.

Now, with a little more experience, I examined the code and found plenty of opportunities for improvement (no problem, it just means I got better as a programmer).

So, I started this 'second fase' of Burglar by refactoring some methods I had just assembled to get things working. When I finish this I'll start refactoring the very structure of the program, that I believe can be greatly improved, and writing the tests (Yes, Burglar is legacy code. Fortunately, I remember most of the decisions I made when coding the earlier version).
