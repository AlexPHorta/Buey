.. type: text

Buey is my branchild. I'm Alexandre Paloschi Horta, a developer, mostly of Python apps, although I'm also tinkering with Javascript and Haskell. Besides that, I'm the vocalist of the Thrash/Death Metal band Lockfist 669, and the Doom Metal band Dead End Kings. I write short stories too, but they're in my mother language (portuguese), so no place for them in here.

I love working on the plumbing, messing with the hooks and crannies of software (yes, I'm more of a backend developer).
