Buey is my branchild. I'm Alexandre Paloschi Horta, a developer, mostly of Python apps, although I'm also tinkering with Javascript and Haskell. Besides that, I'm the vocalist of the Thrash/Death Metal band Lockfist 669, and the Doom Metal band Dead End Kings. I write short stories too, but they're in my mother language (portuguese), so no place for them in here. Last, and most important of all, I'm the husband of my dearest Thays and proud father of Bárbara (my beloved pepper jello) and Lavínia (my beloved star in the skies).

I love working on the plumbing, messing with the hooks and crannies of software (yes, I'm more of a backend developer). I put a lot of effort into structuring a project and building something that is as easy to maintain as possible.
