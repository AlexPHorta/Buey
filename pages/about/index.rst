.. type: text

Buey is the branchild of Alexandre Paloschi Horta. I'm a developer, mostly of Python apps, although I'm also tinkering with Javascript and Haskell. Besides that, I'm the vocalist of the Thrash/Death Metal band Lockfist 669, and the Doom Metal band Dead End Kings. I write stories too, but they're in my original language (portuguese), so no place for them in here.
