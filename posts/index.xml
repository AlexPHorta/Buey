It would be a match-3 style game, but with a twist. The stones wouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow a rectangular grid, but a circular one. In a way, it&amp;rsquo;s something like four binary trees arranged in a circle. The stones appear randomly in one of the four central slots. Then, you have to decide if you move the grid clockwise or counter-clockwise. Choice made, the stone will migrate to the immediate outer circle in the direction of your choosing, and another one will surge in the center (in one of the four central slots and of random color).</description></item><item><title>Interesting cast issue in Java</title><link>https://www.buey.net.br/posts/interesting-cast-issue-java/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 22:53:19 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.buey.net.br/posts/interesting-cast-issue-java/</guid><description>Some days ago I was convinced by my friend Fernando to start learning Java. I wondered, &amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo;. While examining the first chapters of Java - A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide, I stumbled upon this interesting &amp;ldquo;issue&amp;rdquo;.
Because of Java&amp;rsquo;s automatic type promotion in expressions, an aparently correct code can cause compilation errors. See&amp;hellip;
byte b = 20; b = b * 2; // This will trigger a compilation error. You can&amp;#39;t assign an int to a byte.</description></item><item><title>Never in straight lines</title><link>https://www.buey.net.br/posts/never-straight-lines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 22:10:02 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.buey.net.br/posts/never-straight-lines/</guid><description>Today I ordered a pizza. I took the car and went to the restaurant to grab the order, instead of waiting for the delivery guy. It&amp;rsquo;s something I do from time to time. I payed for the pizza and walked to the car to get back home.
Then, this guy approached me, a total stranger. He had an unusual request to make. He asked me to give him a ride, so he could try to catch a bus somewhere else (the restaurant is located in a neighborhood not well served by bus lines).</description></item><item><title>I need a programming project idea</title><link>https://www.buey.net.br/posts/programming-project-idea/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 09:56:02 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.buey.net.br/posts/programming-project-idea/</guid><description>The most common question I read in every thread, and I imagine you already have too, is &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m new at programming and I want to practice, can someone give me some project ideas?&amp;rdquo;.
Usually people have a very long list of responses right under the sleeve, and the options range from programming challenges to traditional and easy to build programs like a pomodoro timer, or a reminder. There are even complete projects devoted to this situation, some of them very interesting (and I&amp;rsquo;ll list them at the end of this post), but I want to share a different approach.</description></item></channel></rss>
