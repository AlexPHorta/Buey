Buey is my brainchild. I'm Alexandre Paloschi Horta, an aspiring developer.  I program in Python, and I'm also getting my feet wet in Javascript.  Besides that, I'm member of the Doom/Death Metal band Macacos da Manchúria, and I write short stories too, but they're in my native language (portuguese), so no place for them in here. Last, and most important of all, I'm the husband of my dearest Thays and proud father of Bárbara (my beloved pepper jello) and Lavínia (my beloved star in the skies, some day we'll meet again).
