Buey is my brainchild. I'm Alexandre Paloschi Horta, a developer, mostly of Python apps (although I'm also tinkering with C). Besides that, I'm member of the Doom/Death Metal band Macacos da Manchúria. I write short stories too, but they're in my native language (portuguese), so no place for them in here. Last, and most important of all, I'm the husband of my dearest Thays and proud father of Bárbara (my beloved pepper jello) and Lavínia (my beloved star in the skies).

I love working on the plumbing, messing with the hooks and crannies of software (yes, I'm more of a backend developer). I put a lot of effort into structuring a project and building something that is as easy to maintain as possible.
