NSEW Virtual Keyboard
===========================

NSEW is a virtual keyboard designed for text insertion with the directional keys of a remote controller (up, right, down, left and enter) or a numpad.  The normal keyboard layout (a retangular box) is clumsy when used with this kind of device or in these specific conditions.

NSEW solves this situation minimizing the number of strokes needed to select a specific character, in accordance with the common letter frequency of the selected language (English is the default).

The user presses the directional keys until the desired character is under the cursor, then presses ENTER (or 5, in this demonstration).  The chosen character is inserted in the field area and the cursor gets back to the central position (the Mode key).
