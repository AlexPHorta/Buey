      <description>The most common question I read in every thread, and I imagine you already have too, is &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m new at programming and I want to practice, can someone give me some project ideas?&amp;quot;.
Usually people have a very long list of responses right under the sleeve, and the options range from programming challenges to traditional and easy to build programs like a pomodoro timer, or a reminder. There are even complete projects devoted to this situation, some of them very interesting (and I&amp;rsquo;ll list them at the end of this post), but I want to share a different approach.</description>
