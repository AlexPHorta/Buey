      <description>Today I ordered a pizza. I took the car and went to the restaurant to grab the order, instead of waiting for the delivery guy. It&amp;rsquo;s something I do from time to time. I payed for the pizza and walked to the car to get back home.
Then, this guy approached me, a total stranger. He had an unusual request to make. He asked me to give him a ride, so he could try to catch a bus somewhere else (the restaurant is located in a neighborhood not well served by bus lines).</description>
